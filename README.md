The Lead Management System is designed to streamline the process of managing leads for sales teams, enabling them to efficiently track, nurture, and convert leads into customers. The system provides tools for managing reminders, communicating with leads via bulk email/SMS, and team collaboration. It centralizes lead data, enhances productivity, and ultimately improves sales performance. A user-friendly prototype design has been developed to visually represent the systemâ€™s core features, user interface, and workflow, aiding in early validation and iterative improvements.
